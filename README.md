1. Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on the ordering) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the beginning (or end) of the sorted portion.

2. Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

3. Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the list one element at a time, inserting each element into its proper position in the previously sorted portion of the list.

4. Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by splitting the list into smaller sublists, sorting each sublist, and then merging the sorted sublists back together to form the final sorted list.

5. Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the list around the pivot, and then recursively sorting the sublists on either side of the pivot.

6. Heap Sort

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure to sort the list. It works by building a heap, then repeatedly removing the largest (or smallest) element from the heap and placing it at the end (or beginning) of the sorted list.

7. Counting Sort

Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that works by counting the number of occurrences of each element in the list, then using these counts to determine the final position of each element in the sorted list.

8. Radix Sort

Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by sorting the list based on the digits of the elements. It is particularly useful for sorting large lists of integers or strings.

9. Bucket Sort

Bucket sort is a distribution sort that works by dividing the list into smaller buckets, each of which is then sorted individually. The sorted buckets are then combined to form the final sorted list.

10. Bingo Sort

Bingo sort is a variation of the insertion sort algorithm that uses a binary search to find the correct position for each element in the sorted portion of the list.

11. Shell Sort

Shell sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into smaller sublists, each of which is then sorted using insertion sort. The sublists are then merged to form the final sorted list.

12. Tim Sort

Tim sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines elements of merge sort and insertion sort. It is known for its high performance and is used as the default sorting algorithm in Python.

13. Comb Sort

Comb sort is an improved version of bubble sort that eliminates "turtles" (small values near the end of the list) to improve performance.

14. Pigeonhole Sort

Pigeonhole sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of the list into a number of buckets, each of which is then sorted individually. The sorted buckets are then combined to form the final sorted list.

15. Cycle Sort

Cycle sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by finding cycles in the list and rotating them to their correct positions.

16. Cocktail Sort

Cocktail sort is a variation of bubble sort that alternates the direction of the passes through the list to improve performance.

17. Strand Sort

Strand sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into smaller sublists, each of which is then sorted individually. The sorted sublists are then merged to form the final sorted list.

18. Bitonic Sort

Bitonic sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into smaller sublists, each of which is then sorted individually. The sorted sublists are then merged to form the final sorted list.

19. Pancake Sort

Pancake sort is a sorting algorithm that works by flipping the largest unsorted pancake to the top of the list, then flipping it to its correct position.

20. Permutation Sort

Permutation sort is a sorting algorithm that works by generating all possible permutations of the list, then selecting the sorted one.

21. Gnome Sort

Gnome sort is a variation of insertion sort that uses a series of swaps to move elements to their correct positions.

22. Sleep Sort

Sleep sort is a sorting algorithm that works by using multiple threads to sort the list, with each thread sleeping for a time proportional to the value of the element it is sorting.

23. Stooge Sort

Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into smaller sublists, each of which is then sorted individually. The sorted sublists are then merged to form the final
