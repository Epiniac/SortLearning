- Selection Sort
  Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

- Bubble Sort
  In Bubble Sort algorithm,

        traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side.
        In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.
        This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

- Insertion Sort
  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

  Insertion sort is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

- Merge Sort
  Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
